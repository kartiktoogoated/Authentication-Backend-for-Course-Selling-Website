# Authentication-Backend-for-Course-Selling-Website

This repository contains the backend code for a course purchasing platform. The project aims to provide a robust backend solution for managing courses, user authentication, and course purchases. It utilizes Node.js along with Express.js for building the RESTful API endpoints, MongoDB as the database for storing course and user data, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication using JWT tokens to allow users to register, login, and access protected routes.
Course Management: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for managing courses, including functionalities to add new courses, update course details, and delete courses.
Purchase Workflow: Implement a purchase workflow allowing authenticated users to purchase courses, with features such as adding courses to the cart, viewing cart items, and completing the purchase process.
Payment Integration: Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to facilitate secure online payments for course purchases.
User Dashboard: Develop a user dashboard where users can view their purchased courses, track their progress, and manage their account settings.
Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing course and user data in a flexible and scalable manner.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure method for transmitting authentication data between client and server.This repository contains the backend code for a course purchasing platform.
